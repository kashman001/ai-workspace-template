# Session Handoff — 2026-08-05 (session 4: documentation phase shipped in one commit; WARN rollover into implementation phase)

Executed the session-3 launcher's documentation plan verbatim; no design was
reopened. Substance is in the committed docs themselves; this block is
provenance only.

- One commit, `9c6a097`, pushed to main: `docs/context-budget.md` gained
  "Rollover trigger policy" / "Relaunch knobs" / "Multi-session model"
  sections (each with an explicit design-accepted-implementation-pending
  status note) and corrected stale copilot-cli "unverified" claims (smoke
  test verified 73.0k exact); knob block landed in `context-budget.env`
  (`ROLLOVER_RELAUNCH=manual`, `ROLLOVER_RUNTIME=claude`);
  `skills/session-rollover/SKILL.md` gained hybrid trigger semantics, the
  hook-less cadence fallback (~10 exchanges), and the relaunch closing step
  (graceful when the script is absent); pointer lines in `CONTEXT.md` +
  `docs/workspace-structure.md`; ADR-0004 companion promoted from the three
  session-3 notes (Promote? fields flipped; ADR-0003 got a Refined-by link);
  `issues/01-vscode-agent-mode-hooks.md` ticket created; backlog card M13
  (registry-clobber bug, Open with approved fix) + scorecard updated.
- Doc-phase decision recorded in `decisions.md` (newest note): one companion
  ADR-0004, not an amended 0003 or four ADRs.
- Ops note: `workspace-structure.md`'s scripts tree already lists planned
  entries (`scripts/tests/` doesn't exist on disk), so the
  `launch-next-session.sh` tree line landing pre-implementation is consistent;
  `check-workspace-structure.sh` iterates existing scripts only.
- WARN (122.7K) fired at commit time; user approved rollover. Docs summary was
  presented; user raised no objections before approving — treat the doc set as
  baseline unless they say otherwise.

Suggested skills for the next session: `superpowers:writing-plans` or `tdd`
(implementation of the registry migration), `decision-log`,
`session-rollover` at the boundary.

# Session Handoff — 2026-08-05 (session 3: ALL open questions closed; research + smoke tests landed; user-directed rollover into documentation phase)

Design discussion is COMPLETE. Every open question is closed and recorded;
substance lives in `relaunch-analysis.md` (open-questions section, final
state), `decisions.md` (three new Tier-2 notes), and the three research docs.
This block is provenance only.

- Closed with user: #1 multi-session identity redesign approved (operating
  model: one developer, N concurrent sessions, one per work item); #2 knobs
  (`context-budget.env`, off/manual/auto, `manual` default); #3 all four hook
  deployments in scope (smoke tests collapsed the deferral rationale); #4
  launcher covers all five runtimes seeded-interactive, background claude-only.
- Research delivered (background agents): `vendor-hooks-research.md` (all
  four runtimes PUSH-CAPABLE — the "agent discipline only" matrix rows were
  stale); `smoke-test-opencode.md` (opencode 1.18.14 installed; chat.message
  injection CONFIRMED live, part shape trap documented; sqlite token store);
  `smoke-test-copilot.md` (copilot CLI 1.0.78 installed; hooks CONFIRMED
  live; `copilot -i` seeded-interactive REFUTED the headless-only claim;
  VS Code agent mode ships hooks since v1.109, Preview, reads our formats —
  live verification is the one spun-out ticket).
- Machine state changed: opencode (brew) + copilot CLI (npm) now installed;
  scratch test dirs under the session scratchpad; a stray `$schema` line
  opencode auto-added to `.opencode/opencode.json` was reverted.
- Next phase (user-agreed sequence): documentation first, then
  implementation. See `next-session.md`.

Suggested skills for the next session: `writing-for-agents` (doc edits),
`decision-log` (promotions to the ADR-0003 family), `checkpoint` or
`session-rollover` at the boundary.

# Session Handoff — 2026-08-05 (session 2: design discussion — hybrid settled, ADR-0003, codification walkthrough, multi-session redesign proposed; WARN rollover)

Same calendar day as session 1, fresh context. All substance lives in
`relaunch-analysis.md` (written incrementally — effective write-ahead) and
ADR-0003; this block is provenance only.

- Settled with user: consent axis reframe; hybrid trigger (WARN asks, STOP
  automatic); dying agent conducts rollover; write-ahead on declined WARN;
  answer-then-rollover as discussion atomic step; D1–D8 local-vs-LLM verdicts
  + conductor state machine.
- ADR-0003 promoted (user-directed) from a Tier-2 note; committed + indexed.
- User challenged D6 (global active-project state) → multi-session identity
  redesign proposed (session-keyed state + per-project advisory lock);
  **awaiting user verdict** — the successor's first question.
- The registry-clobber bug fired live mid-session (record measured the dead
  demo session); evidence in the analysis, workaround in
  docs/operational-knowledge.md.
- Commits this session: 506a68e, 8e2ac7d, 8eabdb0, 56dc888 + the rollover
  commit; all pushed to main.

# Session Handoff — 2026-08-05 (session 1: project spun out of template-maintenance; demo run; analysis captured)

Spun out of `work/template-maintenance/` mid-discussion: its queued
`launch-next-session.sh` mission grew into this focused project at the user's
request ("this deserves a good discussion and proper focused project").

What got done this session (while still under template-maintenance):
- Verified launch flags against installed CLIs — caught that
  `claude --bg --name` doesn't exist (no `--name` flag).
- Live demo: `claude --bg` launched a detached seeded session in this cwd; it
  read the launcher and answered correctly in ~11s; stopped cleanly.
- Full analysis written to `relaunch-analysis.md` (pipeline concept, vendor
  matrix, knob proposal, four open questions).
- User widened scope beyond the script: cross-vendor *triggering* reliability
  and workspace-parameter optionality are explicitly part of the problem.

State: no code written; `main` clean apart from this new work directory and a
retarget note in `work/template-maintenance/next-session.md`. Immediate next
step: the open-questions discussion (see launcher).
